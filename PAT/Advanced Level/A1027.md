# A1027 Colors in Mars (20 point(s))
People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for *Red*, the middle 2 digits for *Green*, and the last 2 digits for *Blue*. The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.
<!-- more -->
## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.

## Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output *#*, then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a *0* to its left.

## Sample Input:
> 15 43 71

## Sample Output:
> #123456

    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    cout << '#';
    cout << get(a/13) << get(a%13);

    cout << get(c/13) << get(c%13);
    return 0;
